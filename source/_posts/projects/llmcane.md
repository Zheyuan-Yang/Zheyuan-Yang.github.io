# Executive Summary

Currently, over 300 million people worldwide suffer from severe visual impairment. But the existing solutions, such as the Augmented Cane lack portability, and the ability to function in complex environment.

To address these limitations, we have designed a navigation assistance tool that integrates large language models(LLMs) with SLAM, aiming to provide a more intelligent and responsive solution to assist the movement of visually impaired people. Combining the models with a variety of sensors, the cane is capable of providing intuitive audio feedback on both obstacle avoidance and navigation assistance.

After six months of intensive development, we successfully produced an LLM Cane capable of full indoor navigation and partial outdoor functionality. Comparing to usual white canes, the LLM Cane can increase the user's walking speed by 45%, decrease number of collisions by 83% during indoor scenarios. For outdoor navigation, we show that the LLM Cane can react to user's natural language query and access third-party API to fetch navigation route.

Our prototype demonstrates the feasibility of combining SLAM with Visual Language Models to assist visually impaired users to navigate complex environments, achieving real-time obstacle avoidance and natural language pathfinding. Additionally, it is also equipped with visual questioning and answering to assist users in understanding the environment nearby.
